PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)
You are building PawPal+, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

Scenario
A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan
Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

What you will build
Your final app should:

Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors
Features
Greedy scheduling — packs tasks into the owner's daily time budget using a first-fit algorithm ranked by urgency score (priority + frequency), preferred categories, and duration
Urgency scoring — ranks tasks numerically (high: 100, medium: 50, low: 10) with a frequency boost (daily +20, weekly +5) to determine scheduling order
Preferred category promotion — tasks in the owner's preferred categories are moved to the front of the scheduling queue at equal urgency
Chronological sorting — scheduled tasks are reordered by HH:MM start time after packing; flexible tasks (no fixed time) are placed last
Same-pet conflict detection — flags overlapping timed tasks within a single pet's schedule using the interval overlap condition a_start < b_end and b_start < a_end
Cross-pet conflict detection — detects time overlaps across multiple pets' schedules simultaneously
Daily and weekly recurrence — completing a task automatically queues the next occurrence (daily → +1 day, weekly → +7 days); as_needed tasks are completed only
Task history — completed task records are preserved alongside rescheduled instances for full audit trail
Duplicate prevention — blocks adding a task with the same name and due date to the same pet
Cross-pet filtering — query incomplete, completed, or all tasks across every pet in a single call
Scheduling explanation — generates a plain-language summary of every plan decision, including why low-priority tasks were left out and how many minutes remain
Getting started
Setup
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Suggested workflow
Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
Add tests to verify key behaviors.
Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in app.py.
Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.
Smart Scheduling
PawPal+ goes beyond a basic task list with several scheduling intelligence features built into pawpal_system.py.

Urgency-Based Priority
Tasks are ranked by a numeric urgency score that combines priority (high/medium/low) and frequency (daily/weekly/as_needed). A high-priority daily task always outranks a low-priority weekly one. Within equal urgency, preferred-category tasks are promoted and shorter tasks are scheduled first as a tie-breaker.

HH:MM Time Ordering
Tasks accept a specific time_of_day in HH:MM format (e.g. "08:30"). After the schedule is built, tasks are automatically reordered chronologically so the owner sees a real timeline. Tasks with no fixed time are placed at the end.

Auto-Rescheduling on Completion
When a task is marked complete via Pet.complete_task(), a new instance is automatically created for the next occurrence — tomorrow for daily tasks, 7 days later for weekly tasks. The completed record is preserved as history. as_needed tasks are marked done with no auto-reschedule.

Frequency-Aware Filtering
The scheduler respects task frequency when building the daily plan. Weekly tasks only appear on Mondays. as_needed tasks are excluded from automatic scheduling entirely. Future-dated rescheduled instances are hidden until their due date arrives.

Conflict Detection
Two layers of conflict detection surface time overlaps as warning messages without crashing the app:

Same-pet — Scheduler.detect_conflicts() checks whether any two scheduled tasks for the same pet overlap in time. Called automatically after every generate_plan().
Cross-pet — detect_cross_pet_conflicts(schedulers) compares tasks across different pets to catch cases where the owner would be double-booked.
Testing PawPal+
cd tests
python -m pytest
What the tests cover
Task basics — marking a task complete flips is_completed; adding tasks increases the pet's task count
Task.display_name — falls back to category when name is empty; respects explicit names and "other" category
Task.reschedule — daily tasks reschedule +1 day, weekly +7 days, as_needed returns None; rescheduled tasks start incomplete and preserve all original attributes
Pet.get_tasks — returns an empty list by default and the correct tasks after adds
Pet.add_task duplicate detection — raises ValueError when the same category + due date is added twice; allows the same category on different dates
Pet.complete_task — marks the task done, auto-appends a rescheduled instance for daily/weekly tasks, skips rescheduling for as_needed, raises on unknown or already-completed tasks
Scheduler.generate_plan — respects time budget (fits tasks, skips overflows); schedules by priority (high before low); excludes avoided categories, completed tasks, and as_needed tasks; sorts output chronologically; promotes preferred categories
Scheduler.explain_reasoning — output includes the pet's name, scheduled count, skipped notice when tasks are dropped, and references to preferred/avoided categories
Scheduler.urgency_score — high > medium > low priority; daily > weekly frequency; spot-checks expected numeric values (120 for high/daily, 10 for low/as_needed)
Scheduler.sort_by_time — chronological ordering, flexible (no time) tasks placed last, input list not mutated
Conflict detection (same-pet) — no conflict for non-overlapping or back-to-back tasks; flags partial overlaps, same-start-time, fully contained tasks, 1-minute overlaps, and three-way overlaps; conflict messages name both tasks; sched.conflicts populated after generate_plan()
Cross-pet conflict detection — detect_cross_pet_conflicts() clears non-overlapping schedules, flags overlapping windows across pets, ignores flexible (untimed) tasks
Owner.filter_tasks — no filter returns all tasks; filters by pet name, completion status, or both combined; unknown pet name returns empty list
Owner.add_pet duplicate guard — raises ValueError on duplicate pet names; allows different names
Confidence Level
★★★★★ — All 77 tests pass. Core scheduling logic:

Priority ranking
Time budgeting
Recurrence
Conflict detection
Filtering
Sorting
All were thoroughly covered with both happy path and edge cases.
